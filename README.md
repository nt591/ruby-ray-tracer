# Ruby Ray Tracer

I'm going through Jamis Buck's book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) to help write some Ruby and TDD some code. This is purely for fun. I'll likely attempt this in multiple languages, perhaps rewriting in OCaml (or ReasonML) and maybe C++. I just happen to be pretty comfortable with RSpec as a testing framework and like the Ruby testing ecosystem.

# Running

There's a little helper script that can be run with `ruby ./lib/engine.rb` that builds a PPM file to render some stuff. I'll be making this more useful.
